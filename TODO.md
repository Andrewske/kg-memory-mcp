  - [ ] Log SearchSession records for each search operation
  - [ ] Track query patterns and performance metrics
  - [ ] Add search analytics to stats endpoint

### 3. Performance Optimization 🚀 SCALING
> **Goal**: Optimize for billion-node processing capability

- [ ] **3.1** Implement embedding caching strategy
  - [ ] Cache frequently accessed embeddings
  - [ ] Background embedding pre-computation
  - [ ] Optimize embedding batch operations

- [ ] **3.2** Database performance optimization
  - [ ] Add compound indexes for complex queries
  - [ ] Optimize connection pooling
  - [ ] Add query performance monitoring

### 4. Production Hardening 🛡️ LOW PRIORITY
> **Goal**: Make the server production-ready

- [ ] **4.1** Security Enhancements
  - [ ] Add optional API key authentication middleware
  - [ ] Enhance input sanitization beyond basic validation
  - [ ] Review and optimize request size limits

- [ ] **4.2** Performance Optimizations
  - [ ] Implement response caching for stats/health endpoints
  - [ ] Add graceful shutdown handling with connection draining
  - [ ] Configure request timeout handling

### 5. Deployment Support 🚀 LOW PRIORITY
> **Goal**: Enable easy deployment in various environments

- [ ] **5.1** Docker Support
  - [ ] Create production Dockerfile with multi-stage build
  - [ ] Create docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL service
  - [ ] Add `.dockerignore` and environment examples
  - [ ] Test containerized deployment

- [ ] **5.2** Cloud Deployment Guides
  - [ ] Add Railway/Render deployment guide
  - [ ] Add Vercel/Netlify serverless guide
  - [ ] Create reverse proxy configuration examples
  - [ ] Add AWS/GCP/Azure deployment instructions

## 🎯 AutoSchemaKG Success Criteria

- ✅ **Vector Search**: Actual cosine similarity search with pgvector (COMPLETE)
- ✅ **Multi-Index Strategy**: 5 search types with fusion ranking (COMPLETE)
- ✅ **Token Tracking**: Full cost analytics and usage monitoring (COMPLETE)
- ✅ **Similarity Score Accuracy**: Real vector similarity scores returned (COMPLETE)

- **Collaborative knowledge editing**: Multi-user knowledge graph editing interface
- **Knowledge validation**: AI-powered fact-checking and consistency validation
- **Export formats**: Support for RDF, Neo4j, and other graph database formats
- **Real-time knowledge sync**: Live synchronization between multiple knowledge graph instances
- **Privacy-preserving analytics**: Differential privacy for sensitive knowledge graphs
- **Semantic search suggestions**: AI-powered query expansion and suggestion system
- **Knowledge graph merging**: Tools for combining multiple knowledge graphs
- **Automated knowledge maintenance**: Self-healing knowledge graphs with consistency checks

## ✅ Completed

### Core HTTP Transport ✅
- ✅ Express.js server with all middleware (CORS, compression, helmet, rate limiting)
- ✅ All 6 REST endpoints working (`/api/process-knowledge`, `/api/search-knowledge`, etc.)
- ✅ SSE/MCP compliance at `/api/mcp` endpoint
- ✅ Dual transport support (STDIO + HTTP simultaneously)
- ✅ OpenAPI documentation at `/api/openapi.json`
- ✅ Health monitoring (`/api/health`, `/api/stats`, `/api/metrics`)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (`scripts/test-http-client.mjs`)
- ✅ Environment configuration with `.env.example`

### Token Usage Tracking Implementation ✅
- ✅ **Tiktoken Integration**: Installed and configured tiktoken for accurate token counting
- ✅ **Token Counter Utility**: Created `src/shared/utils/token-counter.ts` with model-specific encoders
- ✅ **Tracked AI Provider**: Enhanced with selective token counting (only when AI SDK doesn't provide usage)
- ✅ **Tracked Embedding Service**: New wrapper that tracks all embedding operations using tiktoken
- ✅ **Background Conceptualization Fix**: Fixed context issues in transport-manager.ts
- ✅ **Complete Coverage**: All AI operations now tracked (extraction, conceptualization, embeddings, search)
- ✅ **Database Integration**: Full token usage storage with cost calculation and analytics
- ✅ **Testing Verified**: Comprehensive tests confirm accurate tracking across all operation types

### Vector Search Implementation ✅
- ✅ **pgvector Integration**: Full PostgreSQL pgvector implementation with vector(1536) types
- ✅ **Vector Operations**: Complete cosine distance search using `<->` operator across all vector types
- ✅ **Multi-Index Search**: Entity, Relationship, Semantic, and Concept vector searches implemented
- ✅ **Fusion Search Algorithm**: Sophisticated multi-index fusion with configurable weights
- ✅ **Real Similarity Scores**: Fixed hardcoded 0.8 scores to use actual pgvector similarity calculations
- ✅ **Database Adapter**: Comprehensive vector search methods with proper similarity score returns
- ✅ **Search Type Routing**: All search endpoints support specific vector search types
- ✅ **AutoSchemaKG Compliance**: Full 5-type search fusion with weighted ranking

### Documentation Updates ✅
- ✅ **README.md Updates**: Added comprehensive HTTP transport setup guide
